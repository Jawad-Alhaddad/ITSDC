# ITSDC
Introduction to self Driving Cars

In this program, youâ€™ll sharpen your Python skills, apply C++, apply matrices and calculus in code, and touch on computer vision and machine learning. These concepts will be applied to solving self-driving car problems.

# Project_1: Implement a Matrix Class (Python)
In this course, you will touch on Object Oriented Programming(OOP) and matrix math skills by filling out the methods in a partially-completed 'Matrix' class.

# Project_2:Translate Python to C
This course introduces the usage of C++ in self-driving cars. The project involves the translation of a given program written in Python into C++.

# Project_3:Implement Rout Planner
Navigating Complex Data Structures involves the algorithm implementation based on Algorithmic thinking that show up most frequently in self-driving cars.
